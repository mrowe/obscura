# Content Model Reference

## Photos and Sidecar Files

Each photo in a gallery can have a companion YAML sidecar file with the same name (e.g., `sunset.jpg` → `sunset.yaml`).

### Sidecar Fields

| Field           | Type     | Description                                          |
|----------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `title`         | string   | Display title for the photo                          |
| `date`          | date     | Date the photo was taken (overrides EXIF)            |
| `camera`        | string   | Camera used (overrides EXIF)                         |
| `lens`          | string   | Lens used (overrides EXIF)                           |
| `focal_length`  | number   | Focal length in mm (overrides EXIF)                  |
| `iso`           | number   | ISO sensitivity (overrides EXIF)                     |
| `aperture`      | number   | Aperture f-number (overrides EXIF)                   |
| `shutter_speed` | string   | Shutter speed, e.g. `"1/250"` (overrides EXIF)      |
| `location`      | string   | Where the photo was taken                            |
| `caption`       | string   | Description or story behind the photo                |
| `gps_lat`       | number   | GPS latitude (overrides EXIF)                        |
| `gps_lon`       | number   | GPS longitude (overrides EXIF)                       |
| `tags`          | string[] | Tags for categorisation                              |
| `photographer`  | string   | Photographer name (overrides EXIF Artist and site default) |
| `license`       | string   | License for this photo (overrides site-wide default) |

Sidecar values always win over EXIF data when both are present. Empty sidecar fields do not override EXIF values.

### Auto-Generated Sidecars

When you run `npm run build`, Obscura creates sidecar files for any photo that doesn't have one yet. These are pre-filled with EXIF data (date, camera, lens, focal length, ISO, aperture, shutter speed, photographer from the EXIF Artist tag) and the title defaults to "Untitled". You only need to add meaningful titles, locations, and captions.

Use `npm run sidecar` to fill in missing fields interactively with terminal image previews, or edit the YAML files by hand. See the [CLI Reference](./cli.md#npm-run-sidecar) for details.

### Gallery Content (Optional)

You can add a markdown file to include formatted text on gallery pages. No frontmatter is needed — titles and metadata come from `galleries.yaml`.

- **`site/content/photos/index.md`** — displayed on the gallery index page (`/photography/`), below the heading and above the gallery cards.
- **`site/content/photos/<gallery>/index.md`** — displayed on an individual gallery page, between the title/description and the photo grid.

```
site/content/photos/street/
├── index.md              ← optional gallery content
├── morning-light.jpg
├── morning-light.yaml
└── ...
```

This is useful for longer introductions, photographer's notes, or contextual information that doesn't fit in the plain-text `description` field.

### Supported Image Formats

JPEG (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`), PNG (`.png`), TIFF (`.tif`, `.tiff`), WebP (`.webp`).

Any other format in a gallery folder causes a build error.

## Site Configuration

All site-wide settings live in `site/config/site.yaml`. Here is a complete reference of every field:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `base_url` | string | yes | `http://localhost:3000` | Public URL of your site (used for absolute links, RSS, sitemap) |
| `title` | string | yes | `My Photography` | Site title — shown in the header, hero, browser tab, and footer copyright |
| `subtitle` | string | no | — | Optional tagline displayed below the title on the homepage hero and as "Title - Subtitle" in the nav bar and browser title |
| `description` | string | no | — | Short site description for OpenGraph/SEO meta tags (not displayed on the page) |
| `theme` | string | yes | `editorial` | Theme to use (looks in `site/themes/` first, then `themes/`) |
| `recent_shots_count` | number | yes | `12` | Number of photos shown in the "Recent Shots" section on the homepage |
| `license` | string | yes | `all-rights-reserved` | Default license for all photos. Options: `all-rights-reserved`, `CC-BY-4.0`, `CC-BY-SA-4.0`, `CC-BY-NC-4.0`, `CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0`, `CC-BY-ND-4.0`, `CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0`, `CC0-1.0`, or any custom text |
| `default_photographer` | string | no | — | Default photographer name for all photos (can be overridden per-photo in sidecar YAML) |
| `hero_image` | string | no | auto-detected | Homepage hero image as `gallery-slug/photo-slug`. If omitted, the first landscape photo from recent shots is used |
| `gallery_default_layout` | string | yes | `masonry` | Default gallery layout: `masonry` (variable-height tiles) or `grid` (uniform cells). Individual galleries can override this in `galleries.yaml` |
| `photo_display_fields` | string[] | no | all fields | Which metadata fields to show on photo detail pages |
| `lightbox_display_fields` | string[] | no | all fields | Which metadata fields to show in the lightbox overlay |
| `social_links` | object[] | no | `[]` | Social media links displayed in the footer |
| `navigation` | object[] | no | default menu | Custom navigation menu items |
| `images.breakpoints` | number[] | yes | `[400, 800, 1200, 2400]` | Responsive image widths to generate |
| `images.webp_quality` | number | yes | `85` | WebP compression quality (1–100) |
| `images.max_dimension` | number | yes | `2400` | Cap on the longest side of any generated variant |

### Minimal example

```yaml
base_url: https://example.com
title: "Jane Doe Photography"
theme: editorial
```

### Full example

```yaml
base_url: https://example.com
title: "Jane Doe Photography"
subtitle: "Landscapes & Portraits"
description: "Photography portfolio by Jane Doe"
theme: editorial
recent_shots_count: 12
license: CC-BY-4.0
default_photographer: Jane Doe
hero_image: landscapes/golden-hour
gallery_default_layout: masonry

images:
  breakpoints: [400, 800, 1200, 2400]
  webp_quality: 85
  max_dimension: 2400
```

See the sections below for detailed documentation of `photo_display_fields`, `lightbox_display_fields`, `navigation`, `social_links`, and `gallery_default_layout`.

## Site Configuration — Image Sizing

```yaml
images:
  breakpoints: [400, 800, 1200, 2400]
  webp_quality: 85
  max_dimension: 2400
```

`max_dimension` caps the **longest side** of every generated variant — width for
landscape photos, height for portraits. A 6000x4000 original is scaled to
2400x1600 before anything else happens; a 4000x6000 portrait becomes 1600x2400.
Capping the longest side rather than the width keeps orientations comparable: a
width-only cap of 2400 would let a portrait through at 2400x3600, more than
twice the pixels of the equivalent landscape.

`breakpoints` are widths, applied to the capped size. Breakpoints wider than the
capped source are skipped, and when the widest applicable breakpoint still
leaves resolution unused, one extra variant is emitted at the capped source
width. Sources are never enlarged.

| Source | Capped to | Variants generated |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|
| 6000x4000 landscape | 2400x1600 | 400w, 800w, 1200w, 2400w |
| 4000x6000 portrait | 1600x2400 | 400w, 800w, 1200w, 1600w |
| 2048x1365 landscape | unchanged | 400w, 800w, 1200w, 2048w |
| 2400x7200 panorama | 800x2400 | 400w, 800w |
| 300x200 small | unchanged | 300w |

Photos smaller than the smallest breakpoint still get one native-size variant
and render normally; the build prints a warning so you know the source is
low-resolution.

Lowering `max_dimension` shrinks your output and speeds up builds at the cost of
detail on HiDPI displays. Raising it above the largest breakpoint lets large
originals through at higher resolution. Changing it re-processes every photo on
the next build.

## Site Configuration — Display Fields

You can control which metadata fields appear on photo detail pages and in the lightbox overlay via `site/config/site.yaml`:

```yaml
# Which fields to show on the photo detail page
photo_display_fields: [date, camera, lens, settings, location, tags, photographer, license]

# Which fields to show in the lightbox overlay
lightbox_display_fields: [date, camera, location, photographer, license]
```

| Field      | What it controls                                         |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `date`     | Capture date                                             |
| `camera`   | Camera model                                             |
| `lens`     | Lens model                                               |
| `settings` | Focal length, aperture, ISO, shutter speed               |
| `location` | Location name                                            |
| `tags`     | Tag list (photo detail page only)                        |
| `photographer` | Photographer name                                    |
| `license`  | License badge                                            |

The shorthand `exif` expands to `date`, `camera`, `lens`, and `settings` — useful if you want all EXIF fields without listing them individually.

Both fields default to showing everything when omitted.

### Exclusion syntax

Instead of listing every field you *do* want, you can exclude specific fields by prefixing them with `-`:

```yaml
# Show everything except photographer
lightbox_display_fields: [-photographer]
```

You cannot mix inclusions and exclusions in the same list.

## Site Configuration — Navigation

Customise the site navigation menu in `site/config/site.yaml`. When omitted, the default menu is used (Photography, Tags, Locations, Blog, About, Contact).

```yaml
navigation:
  - label: Photography
    url: photography
  - label: Tags
    url: tags
  - label: About
    url: page:about
```

Each item has a `label` (display text) and a `url` (link target):

| URL format | Example | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Built-in keyword | `photography`, `tags`, `locations`, `blog` | Links to the corresponding section |
| Page reference | `page:about` | Links to a page in `site/content/pages/`. Build fails if the page doesn't exist |
| Literal path | `/custom/page/` | Used as-is (with `base_path` prepended) |
| External URL | `https://prints.example.com` | Opens in a new tab |

Active-link highlighting works automatically for built-in keywords, page references, and simple `/<slug>/` literal paths.

### Examples

Minimal portfolio (no blog, no tags):

```yaml
navigation:
  - label: Portfolio
    url: photography
  - label: About
    url: page:about
```

With an external link:

```yaml
navigation:
  - label: Photos
    url: photography
  - label: Prints
    url: https://prints.example.com
  - label: About
    url: page:about
```

An empty list (`navigation: []`) removes the menu entirely.

## Site Configuration — Gallery Layout

Set the site-wide default gallery layout in `site/config/site.yaml`:

```yaml
# "masonry" (variable-height tiles, default) or "grid" (uniform cells)
gallery_default_layout: masonry
```

Individual galleries can override this in `galleries.yaml` via the `layout` field.

## Site Configuration — Social Links

Add social media links in `site/config/site.yaml`. These are displayed as monochromatic icons in the site footer, adapting to light and dark mode automatically.

```yaml
social_links:
  - platform: bluesky
    url: https://bsky.app/profile/yourhandle
  - platform: mastodon
    url: https://mastodon.social/@yourhandle
  - platform: flickr
    url: https://www.flickr.com/photos/yourhandle
  - platform: instagram
    url: https://www.instagram.com/yourhandle
  - platform: 500px
    url: https://500px.com/p/yourhandle
  - platform: pixelfed
    url: https://pixelfed.social/yourhandle
  - platform: github
    url: https://github.com/yourhandle
  - platform: glass
    url: https://glass.photo/yourhandle
```

Supported platforms: `500px`, `bluesky`, `flickr`, `github`, `instagram`, `mastodon`, `pixelfed`. Entries with unrecognised platforms or missing URLs are silently ignored.

## Gallery Configuration

Defined in `site/config/galleries.yaml`:

```yaml
galleries:
  - slug: street
    title: Street Photography
    description: Moments from the city   # optional
    listed: true                          # show on gallery index
    layout: masonry                       # overrides gallery_default_layout from site.yaml

  - slug: post-assets
    title: Post Assets
    listed: false                         # hidden from gallery index
```

- **slug**: URL-safe identifier, must match the folder name under `site/content/photos/`
- **listed**: Set to `false` for galleries that should not appear on the gallery index (useful for photos used only in blog posts)
- **layout**: Display layout — `grid` (uniform cells) or `masonry` (variable-height tiles). Optional; overrides the site-wide `gallery_default_layout` setting.

## Blog Posts

Markdown files in `site/content/posts/`. The filename (without `.md`) becomes the URL slug.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: My First Post
date: 2024-06-20
tags:
  - travel
  - berlin
summary: A short description for the blog index
---
```

| Field     | Type     | Required | Description                           |
|----------|----------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `title`   | string   | yes      | Post title                            |
| `date`    | date     | yes      | Publication date                      |
| `tags`    | string[] | yes      | Tags (can be empty `[]`)              |
| `summary` | string   | no       | Shown on blog index and RSS feed      |

### Photo Shortcode

Reference photos from any gallery inside your posts:

```markdown
Check out this photo from Berlin:

{{< photo "street/morning-light" >}}

Or use a bare slug (if the photo name is unique across all galleries):

{{< photo "morning-light" >}}
```

The shortcode renders as a styled photo card with the image and metadata.

**Bare slugs** work only when the photo name is unique across all galleries. If the same filename exists in multiple galleries, you must use the full `gallery/photo` form. An ambiguous or non-existent slug causes a build error.

## Pages

Markdown files in `site/content/pages/`. Each file becomes a top-level page (e.g., `about.md` → `/about/`).

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: About
---
```

| Field   | Type   | Required | Description |
|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | string | yes      | Page title  |

The rest of the file is Markdown content rendered within the site layout.
